### What I do
<p class="text-justify">I am currently part of the awesome web development team at Brighton Inc. There, I focus my efforts on both frontend and backend development. I am strengthening my competencies in HTML/CSS/JS as well as PHP and MySQL development. I work with frontend technologies such as Vue.js as well as develop the backend APIs that drive them.</p>

### Where I'm headed
<p class="text-justify">My goal is to become an established Android application developer. With that in mind, I have so far released an Android app to begin to learn the environment. My plan is to release another app by end of year to further develop my abilities.

In my spare time, I have also begun to experiment with Unity game development using C#. I hope to can find a nice intersection of Android and game development which I will unite both my interests and goals.</p>
