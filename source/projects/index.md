### Clarity (Hexo theme)
This is the theme on which this website relies.
It was based on [Hexo Bootstrap Blog Theme](https://github.com/cgmartin/hexo-theme-bootstrap-blog) initially and used as a base to port my site theme from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).
It can handle multilingual/i18n sites and maintains a minimalistic approach to design.
Read more about the port [here](/en/blog/2017/12/28/first-hexo-post/).
