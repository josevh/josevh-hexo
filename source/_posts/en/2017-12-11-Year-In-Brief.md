A wrap up for the year.
<!-- more -->

## Android

* **Todoer**: No updates.
* **MediaSync**: New project for FTP media backup. Slow development.

## Unity

* Higher priorities exist, oh well.

## Web

* More PHP, wrote own framework/boilerplate for work consisting of:
  * [FlightPHP](http://flightphp.com/)
  * [Phinx](https://phinx.org/)
  * [NotOrm](http://www.notorm.com/)
  * Custom `JS` and `CSS` that cover common functions and styles.
* VueJs is now my go-to frontend `JS` framework.

## Wrap up

Started school again. Still working in web. No time for side projects.  

Hope to have more time to experiment next year.
