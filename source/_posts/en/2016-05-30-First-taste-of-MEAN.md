Today, on Memorial Day, I took the opportunity to look into something I've been wanting to experiment with for a while now, the MEAN stack.<!-- more -->After hearing about summer camps that will be made available in school for learning about the MEAN stack I decided to look into it myself.

My experience in Javascript is of a novice and, fortunately, my reliance on jQuery has proven to be sufficient so far for my needs. However, I feel I have under-utilized Javascript so far and that there is considerable benefit to investing time in learning more about Node.js, Express, Angular and MongoDB.

In search of good tutorials I came about two very good tutorials which were a breeze to follow and encompassed enough to feel comprehensive. I recommend these very much, they've helped me reach a good understanding of the different components and their role.
